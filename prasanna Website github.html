    <p class="p"> In 2004, after years of dedicated prayer and preparation, <strong> Paulraj</strong> established New Calvary
    Ministries. Starting in a modest building with a small congregation, the church quickly grew in both size and
    influence. This growth is attributed to <strong> Paulraj</strong>'s passionate preaching and unwavering dedication
    to his community.

    Pastor Paulraj's vision was to create a church that nurtured spiritual growth while also actively addressing the
    social and economic needs of the community. Under his leadership, New Calvary Ministries has become a beacon of hope
    and support, significantly impacting many lives.</p>
